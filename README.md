# This repo includes the projects that I want to accomplish for Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.
This repo contains bash scripts to have a better understanding on the GPIOs of Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.

Ultimately this repo will be filled with scripts which can be used to further utilize the power of the pi.

I am planning to add a script that controls a FAN (DC Motor) by PWM functionality of the GPIO class.

Note that the scipt will be added to init.d/ directory to start on startup.
